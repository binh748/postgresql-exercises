# PostgreSQL Exercises

This repository holds all my PostgreSQL answers to the exercises on [pgexercises.com](https://pgexercises.com/), which "provides a series of [PostgreSQL] questions and explanations built on a single, simple dataset."

I was inspired to start this repository when I saw a similar repository on [Spencer Koo's GitHub](https://github.com/spencerkoo/SQL_practice). I'm using these exercises to practice PostgreSQL in preparation for data analyst/data scientist interviews.
